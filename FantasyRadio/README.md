# Fantasy Radio

Welcome to **Fantasy Radio** – a unique blend of fantasy vibes with the cozy atmosphere of lofi and fantasy radios. This project is a personal playground where I combined my love for fantasy with the relaxing energy of lofi music, creating a space ideal for studying and immersive relaxation.

## Overview

I wanted to combine my love for fantasy with the cozy vibes of lofi and fantasy radios. This site blends both, creating a space for studying while listening to online radio stations across different genres. It features various ambiences and tools to enhance immersion. This was my first project where I brought together what I’ve learned about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Features

- **Multiple Ambiences:** Enjoy a range of immersive environments, each with its own unique background, sound effects, and live radio streams.
- **Custom Sound Effects:** Toggle ambient sounds like fire, rain, and forest surroundings to tailor your listening experience.
- **Dynamic Radio Integration:** Listen to live YouTube streams seamlessly integrated into the site.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Animated fireflies, bonfires, rain effects, and an audio visualizer add to the relaxing vibe.
- **Extras Modal:** A section with personal information and a "Buy me a coffee" link for support.
- **Rested Time Tracker:** Keep track of how long you’ve been enjoying the chill vibes (coming soon!).
